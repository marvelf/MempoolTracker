# MempoolTracker
A little project that sends a push notification to user on desktop when Bitcoin fees are under 20sat/vb.

As of now, I've only been able to get this to work when running manually and only then will a notification appear if the fees are below the set amount. 

Future updates:
My hope is to get it to the point where it can run in the background without having to manually run the program through VS Code. 
Prevent spamming of notifications.
Ability to customize when notifications appear.
