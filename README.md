# MempoolTracker
A little project that sends a push notification on users desktop when Bitcoin fees are under 20sat/vb.<br><br>

As of now, I've only been able to get this to work when running manually and only then will a notification appear if the fees at that moment are below the set amount. <br><br>

Future updates:<br>
My hope is to get it to the point where it can run in the background without having to manually run the program through VS Code. <br>
Prevent spamming of notifications.<br>
Ability to customize when notifications appear.<br>
